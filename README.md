Key business questions:  
- Which customer attributes predict response to marketing?  
- Which campaigns performed best by segment?  
- How can next campaigns be optimized dynamically?

> 💡 Marketing Analyst mindset:
This project shows how data-driven insights can refine customer targeting, optimize marketing spend, and directly improve campaign ROI — connecting analytics to business outcomes.
